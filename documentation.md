## Minecraft Documentation
Much of the work done deconstructing minecraft and its network protocol has been done and documented on wiki.vg.  Sadly wiki.vg has been taken down by the owner and the pages have been moved [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge).  Included in this repo I have a markdown copy of the protocol documentation as a contingency.
